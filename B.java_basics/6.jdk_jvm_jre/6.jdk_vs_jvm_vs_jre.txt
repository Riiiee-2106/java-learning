Explanation of each component in the diagram:

### JDK (Java Development Kit)

The JDK is a complete package required to **develop, compile, and run Java programs**.
It is mainly used by **developers**.


The JDK is a software development kit required to develop Java applications.

It includes:

JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

Java compiler (javac) to convert source code into bytecode

Java interpreter/launcher (java) to run Java programs

Javadoc tool to generate program documentation

Other development tools needed for Java programming

Essentially, the JDK is a superset of the JRE, meaning it contains everything needed to both develop and run Java applications.


JDK contains:

* JRE (to run programs)
* Development tools (to create programs)

Without JDK, you cannot write or compile Java programs.

---

### Java Development Tools (inside JDK)

These tools are used during **program development**.

Examples:

* `javac` – compiler that converts `.java` file to `.class` file
* `java` – runs the Java program
* `javadoc` – generates documentation
* `jar` – creates executable JAR files

Purpose:
Used to **write, compile, debug, and package** Java applications.

---

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

JRE is required to **run Java programs**, but not to develop them.
It is mainly used by **end users**.

JRE contains:

* JVM
* Java libraries
* Supporting files

If you only want to run a Java application, JRE is sufficient.

---

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

The JVM is the **core component** of Java.

What it does:

* Loads the `.class` file (bytecode)
* Verifies bytecode for security
* Converts bytecode into machine code
* Executes the program

Each operating system has its own JVM, but the bytecode remains the same.
This is the main reason for Java’s platform independence.

---

### Set of Java Libraries

These are **predefined classes and APIs** provided by Java.

Examples:

* `java.lang` (String, Math, Object)
* `java.util` (ArrayList, Scanner)
* `java.io` (File handling)
* `java.net` (Networking)

Purpose:
They help programmers perform common tasks easily without writing code from scratch.

---

### Other Files

These are supporting files required for proper execution of Java programs.

They include:

* Configuration files
* Security files
* Native libraries

Purpose:
They help JVM and JRE function smoothly and securely.

---

### One-line conclusion (Exam-ready)

JDK is used to develop and run Java programs, JRE provides the runtime environment, and JVM executes bytecode to ensure platform-independent execution.



Real-World Usage of JDK (Java Development Kit)

Who uses it: Java developers

Usage:
The JDK is used to develop Java applications. Developers write code, compile it, test it, and create final programs using JDK tools.

Example:
A software developer building a banking system, college management software, or e-commerce website installs the JDK to write and compile Java programs.

Real-World Usage of JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

Who uses it: End users

Usage:
The JRE is used to run Java applications, not to develop them.

Example:
A user installs a Java-based exam software, billing application, or desktop tool. The user only needs JRE to run the program, not the JDK.

Real-World Usage of JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

Who uses it: System (internally used by Java)

Usage:
The JVM executes Java bytecode and ensures platform independence and security.

Example:
The same Java program runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS because each system has its own JVM that converts bytecode into machine-specific instructions.

One-line exam summary

JDK is used to develop Java programs, JRE is used to run Java programs, and JVM is responsible for executing bytecode and providing platform independence.
