1. Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems(early 1990s) Originally named 'Oak' , later renamed java in 1995.
 (A) "WRITE ONCE, READ ANYWHERE" ---- first release (1995): Introduced "write once,run anywhere" concept with cross-platform compatibility.

4. Each processor has a different instruction set. When you write a program in C/C++ or similar languages, the compiler converts the source code directly into machine code (0s and 1s) that is specific to that processor, motherboard, and operating system.
   Because of this, the compiled program can run only on the same type of machine for which it was compiled. If you want to run the program on another machine, you must recompile the source code again using a compiler for that specific platform.

5. This is a disadvantage, as it reduces portability and increases dependency on hardware and operating systems.

6. Java solves this problem by introducing an intermediate step. Java source code is compiled into bytecode, which is not machine-specific. This bytecode is executed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) available on different platforms (PC, Solaris, Macintosh, etc.).

7. Hence, the same Java program can run on multiple systems without recompilation, following the principle:
   “Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)”.

 (B) "BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY" -----Developed with vision of backward compatibility
9. Java was developed with the vision of backward compatibility. This means that older Java programs continue to run on newer versions of Java without modification.

10. How Java differs from other languages

 In many languages like C/C++, changes in compilers, libraries, or standards may require rewriting or recompiling code, and older programs may break.

 Java ensures backward compatibility by not removing old features abruptly and by maintaining support for older APIs.

11. How Java achieves backward compatibility

Stable JVM:
Bytecode generated by older Java versions can still run on newer JVMs.

Consistent APIs:
Existing classes and methods are preserved even when new features are added.

Deprecated, not removed:
Old features are first marked as deprecated instead of being removed immediately.

12. Example

A program written in Java 1.2 can still run on Java 8, Java 11, or Java 17 JVM.

13. Example:

String s = new String("Hello");


This code written years ago still works today.

(C)Java was first released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems. Since then, Java has evolved through many versions while maintaining backward compatibility.

Java 1.0 (1995): First stable release; platform-independent using JVM.

Java 1.2 (1998): Introduced Collections Framework (major improvement).

Java 5 (2004): Added generics, enhanced for-loop, autoboxing, annotations.

Java 8 (2014): Introduced lambda expressions, Stream API, default methods (very important version).

Java 11 (2018): Long-Term Support (LTS) version; performance and security improvements.

Java 17 (2021): LTS version with modern language features and better performance.

Java 21 (2023): Latest LTS version; introduced virtual threads, pattern matching improvements, and high scalability.

Java 23 (2024): Non-LTS feature release; includes preview and incubator features, JVM and API enhancements.
