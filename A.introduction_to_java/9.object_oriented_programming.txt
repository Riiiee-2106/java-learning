Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — 

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming method in which a program is designed using classes and objects that represent real-world entities.

A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance of that class.

Example (Human)

Class: Human

Properties (Data):
name, age, height, weight

Methods (Behavior):
walk(), talk(), eat(), sleep()

Here, the Human class defines common characteristics and actions, while each object (person) has its own values.


One-line  definition=
Object-Oriented Programming models real-world entities using classes (blueprints) and objects (instances) with properties and behaviors.

Example: Hotel

Class: Hotel

Properties (Data Members):
hotelName
location
numberOfRooms
roomPrice
rating

Methods (Behaviors):
bookRoom()
checkIn()
checkOut()
provideFood()
generateBill()

Explanation

The Hotel class acts as a blueprint.
Each hotel object (for example, Taj Hotel or Grand Hotel) will have its own values for these properties but will use the same behaviors.
