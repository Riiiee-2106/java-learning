Operator Precedence:
Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression based on their priority levels. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.

Associativity:
Associativity defines the order of evaluation for operators having the same precedence. It specifies whether the expression is evaluated from left to right or from right to left.
