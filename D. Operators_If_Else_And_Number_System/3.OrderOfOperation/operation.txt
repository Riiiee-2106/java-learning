🔹 BODMAS / PEMDAS Rule

When an expression has multiple operators, BODMAS tells us which operation to do first.

🔤 Meaning of BODMAS
Letter	Meaning
B	Brackets ( )
O	Order (powers, roots)
D	Division ÷
M	Multiplication ×
A	Addition +
S	Subtraction −

P	Parentheses ( )
E	Exponents
M	Multiplication
D	Division
A	Addition
S	Subtraction

📌 Important:

Multiplication & Division → same priority (solve left to right)

Addition & Subtraction → same priority (solve left to right)

🧠 Correct Order (Very Important)

Brackets / Parentheses

Powers / Roots

Division & Multiplication (left to right)

Addition & Subtraction (left to right)

🖼️ Example from Image 1
Expression:
9 ÷ 3 × 2 ÷ 6

Step-by-step (Left to Right for ÷ and ×):

9 ÷ 3 = 3

3 × 2 = 6

6 ÷ 6 = 1

✅ Final Answer: 1

❌ Wrong method: Doing all × first or all ÷ first

🖼️ Example from Image 2
Expression:
8 − 5 + 7 − 1

Step-by-step (Left to Right for + and −):

8 − 5 = 3

3 + 7 = 10

10 − 1 = 9

✅ Final Answer: 9

❗ Very Common Mistake

❌ Thinking:

Multiplication first, then division


✅ Correct:

Multiplication and division → same priority → left to right


Same rule for + and −

💻 BODMAS in Programming (Java Example)
int result = 9 / 3 * 2 / 6;
System.out.println(result);


Output:

1

🧪 Brackets Change Everything
9 ÷ (3 × 2) ÷ 6


Step:

3 × 2 = 6

9 ÷ 6 ÷ 6 = 0.25

📌 One-Line Exam Definition

BODMAS is a rule that defines the order of operations: Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.
