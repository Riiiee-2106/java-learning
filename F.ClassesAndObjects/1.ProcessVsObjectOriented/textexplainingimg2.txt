This image is explaining the **difference between Procedural Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in a simple visual way.

---

## 🔹 Procedural Programming (Left side)

**Idea:**
Focuses on **functions/procedures** that act on data.

**What the picture shows:**

* Data (like files, money, records) is **separate**
* Functions like **withdraw, deposit, transfer** keep moving between data
* Data is passed around from one function to another

**Key points:**

* Data is **not protected**
* Any function can change the data
* Code becomes hard to manage as programs grow

**Example (Java-style idea):**

```java
deposit(account, amount);
withdraw(account, amount);
```

## 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (Right side)

**Idea:**
Focuses on **objects** that contain **both data and methods**.

**What the picture shows:**

* A **Customer object** holds money
* Actions (deposit, withdraw) are done **inside the object**
* Data and behavior are **bound together**

**Key points:**

* Data is **encapsulated** (more secure)
* Easy to maintain and modify
* Models real-world entities (customer, bank, account)

**Example (Java-style idea):**

```java
customer.deposit(amount);
customer.withdraw(amount);
```

## 🆚 Quick Comparison Table

| Procedural             | Object-Oriented         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Function-based         | Object-based            |
| Data is separate       | Data + methods together |
| Less secure            | More secure             |
| Hard to scale          | Easy to scale           |
| Not real-world focused | Real-world modeling     |

### ✅ In simple words:

* **Procedural** → *“Do this, then do that”*
* **OOP** → *“This object knows what to do”*

If you want, I can explain this **with a real-life example**, **Java code**, or **exam-ready answer** 😊
