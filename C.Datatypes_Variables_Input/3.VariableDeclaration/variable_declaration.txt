Statement shown in the image
int age = 20;


This single line does three important things.

1. int → Data Type (circled part)

int tells the type of data

It means: age will store an integer (whole number)

In Java, int usually occupies 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory

Why needed?

JVM must know how much memory to reserve

JVM must know what kind of operations are allowed

Example:

int → whole numbers (10, 20, -5)

float → decimal numbers

char → single character

2. age → Variable Name

age is a name given to a memory location

It is human-readable

Internally, JVM maps age to a memory address

Think of it as:

age = label

Memory address = actual location in RAM

3. = 20 → Value (Assignment)

20 is the actual data

= assigns the value 20 to the variable age

This value is stored in RAM

What happens in memory (RAM)?

Since age is a local primitive variable, it is stored in the stack.

Conceptual memory view
STACK (RAM)
------------------
age   →   20
------------------


JVM reserves memory

Stores value 20

Links it with name age

Why the green box “Reserved Memory”?

JVM reserves a fixed-size memory block

That memory block stores 20

Size is decided by data type (int → 4 bytes)

So:

Memory is allocated

Value is stored

Variable name points to that memory

Important points -


int decides size and type of memory

age is a variable name, not the memory itself

20 is the value stored in RAM

Primitive variables are stored in stack memory

One-line exam answer

The statement int age = 20; declares an integer variable, allocates memory in RAM, and stores the value 20 in that memory location.
