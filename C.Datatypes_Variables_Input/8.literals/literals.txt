### Literals in Java

**Literals** are **fixed values** that are written directly in a program.
They represent **constant data** stored in memory.

Example:

```
int a = 10;
```

Here, `10` is a **literal**.

## Types of Literals in Java

### 1. Integer Literals

Used to represent whole numbers.

Examples:

```
10
-25
0
```

Number systems allowed:

* Decimal: `10`
* Binary: `0b1010`
* Octal: `012`
* Hexadecimal: `0xA`

---

### 2. Floating-Point Literals

Used to represent decimal numbers.

Examples:

```
3.14
2.5f
6.02e23
```

* `f` or `F` → float literal
* Default type → double

---

### 3. Character Literals

Used to represent a single character.

Examples:

```
'a'
'9'
'#'
```

Unicode character:

```
'\u0041'   // A
```

---

### 4. String Literals

Used to represent a sequence of characters.

Examples:

```
"Hello"
"Java Programming"
```

* Stored in **String Constant Pool**
* Immutable in nature

---

### 5. Boolean Literals

Used to represent logical values.

Only two values:

```
true
false
```

---

### 6. Null Literal

Represents **no object reference**.

Example:

```
String s = null;
```

* Can be assigned only to reference variables
* Not allowed for primitive types

---

## Important  Points

* Literals are **not variables**
* Their value **cannot be changed**
* Stored directly in memory
* Improve code readability
