Rules for Identifiers in Java

The allowed characters for identifiers are:

Alphabets: A–Z, a–z

Digits: 0–9

Special characters: $ (dollar sign) and _ (underscore)

An identifier cannot be a Java keyword or reserved word
Examples of keywords: int, class, public, static, void

Identifiers must not start with a digit (0–9)
Correct: age1, _count
Incorrect: 1age, 9total

Java identifiers are case-sensitive
Example: Age, age, and AGE are different identifiers

There is no limit on the length of an identifier,
but it is recommended to use meaningful names of 4–15 characters

Identifiers must not contain spaces
Incorrect: total marks
Correct: totalMarks

Identifiers must not contain special characters such as:
@, #, %, &, !, *, +

Identifiers should follow Java naming conventions:

Variables & methods → camelCase

Classes → PascalCase

Constants → UPPER_CASE

Identifiers should be meaningful and readable
Prefer: studentAge
Avoid: x1, a2

Although $ is allowed, it is not recommended for user-defined identifiers
It is mainly used internally by the JVM and compiler
