Line of code
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);


This line is used to take input from the user (keyboard) in Java.

1️⃣ Scanner (Class)

Scanner is a class present in the package:

java.util.Scanner


It is used to read data like:

integers (nextInt())

floats (nextFloat())

strings (nextLine())

characters, etc.

👉 Think of Scanner as a tool that can read data.

2️⃣ input (Reference Variable)

input is a reference variable

It stores the address of the Scanner object created in memory

Through input, we access Scanner methods

Example:

input.nextInt();
input.nextLine();


👉 Just like a remote controls a TV,
input controls the Scanner object.

3️⃣ new (Keyword)

new is used to create an object in memory

It:

allocates memory in heap

calls the constructor of the class

Without new, no object is created.

4️⃣ Scanner(System.in) (Constructor Call)
🔹 Constructor

Scanner() is a constructor

It initializes the Scanner object

🔹 System.in

System.in is a predefined input stream

It represents the keyboard (standard input)

👉 So this means:

“Create a Scanner object that takes input from the keyboard.”

5️⃣ What happens in MEMORY? 🧠
Step-by-step memory process:

JVM sees new Scanner(System.in)

Memory is allocated in HEAP

Scanner object is created

Address of that object is stored in input

input (reference) is stored in STACK

Memory view:
STACK                     HEAP
------------------        ---------------------
input  -----------▶      Scanner object
                          (linked to System.in)

6️⃣ Why do we need System.in?

Scanner needs a source of input

Possible sources:

System.in → keyboard

File

String

Example:

Scanner sc = new Scanner("Hello");


But most common is:

System.in (keyboard)

7️⃣ How do we use it?
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

int age = input.nextInt();
String name = input.nextLine();


nextInt() → reads integer

nextLine() → reads full line
